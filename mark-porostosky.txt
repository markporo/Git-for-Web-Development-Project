Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

	-The element is then positioned relative to it's nearest ancestor.  You can use top, 		left, right property to then position the element relative to its ancestor.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the 	ability to give it a width? 
	-display: inline-block;
	
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	-block: divs and sections and p 
	-inline: span and a
	-inline-block: input, button, 


    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
	-It's how content is viewed.  The content is in the middle the padding is apart of the content --an extension to its width or height.  The border goes around that content and is the last edge of the content.  Then the margin is a separate space around the content.  
	-The fix is to use box-sizing: border-box. However, margins will still be outside of the elements even with this fix.
